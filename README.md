**Project summary**: NYC is one of the cities with both highest traffic volumn and highest business density. We are curious about how the business zones in NYC are connected with each other. To explore our thought, we built an R shiny app for the business intelligence purpose based on the NYC taxi data from 2015.7 ~2016.6. This app includes three parts: 1st part gives a map showing the direction of taxi transfers within specific time interval and taxi types(green taxies or yellow taxies); 2nd part gives some EDA of the dataset we chose; and the last part shows the network of 263 business zones and the connections between the 6 borough in NYC.
